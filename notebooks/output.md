Here are organized notes summarizing the key points from the transcript on prompt engineering for Kaggle:

## Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering

- Prompt engineering is the art of getting large language models (LLMs) to do exactly what you want
- Anyone can write a prompt, but crafting effective prompts for complex tasks like code generation requires skill
- Goal: Equip Kagglers with practical prompt engineering techniques to improve their work

## Configuring LLM Output

### Output Length
- Number of tokens impacts costs and processing time 
- May need to engineer prompts to be more targeted for concise responses

### Sampling Controls
- Temperature: Controls randomness
  - Low temperature: More predictable output, good for specific code generation
  - High temperature: More diverse and creative output, good for brainstorming
- Top K and Top P (nucleus sampling): Limit next word selection to most probable candidates
- Recommended starting points:
  - General coherence: Temperature ~0.2, Top P 0.95, Top K 30
  - Creative output: Temperature 0.9, Top P 0.99, Top K 40
  - Factual accuracy: Temperature 0.1, Top P 0.9, Top K 20
  - Single correct answer: Temperature 0

### Repetition Loop Bug
- Model gets stuck repeating words/phrases
- Can occur at both low and high temperatures
- Fine-tune sampling parameters to avoid

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Basic Techniques
- Zero-shot prompting: Provide task description without examples
- One-shot and few-shot prompting: Include examples to guide the model
- Document prompts to track what works and improve over time

### Advanced Techniques
- System prompting: Set overall context and purpose
- Role prompting: Give LLM a specific persona
- Contextual prompting: Provide relevant background information
- Step-back prompting: Ask broader question before specific task
- Chain of Thought (CoT): Generate intermediate reasoning steps
- Self-consistency: Generate multiple reasoning paths and choose most consistent
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT): Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- ReAct (Reason and Act): Combine reasoning with external tool use
- Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE): AI generates and evaluates prompt variations

## Code-Specific Prompting

- Applications: Writing code, explaining code, translating code, debugging/reviewing code
- Always review and test generated code carefully
- Use for understanding unfamiliar code or collaborating with teammates

## Best Practices

- Provide examples (one-shot/few-shot prompting)
- Design simple, clear, and concise prompts
- Be specific about desired output format
- Use instructions over constraints
- Control max token length
- Use variables in prompts for reusability
- Experiment with input formats and writing styles
- Adapt to model updates and new features
- Use structured output formats (CSV, JSON) when appropriate
- Collaborate with other prompt engineers
- Document prompt attempts and results
- Treat prompt engineering as an iterative process

## Conclusion

- Mastering prompt engineering techniques can give Kagglers a competitive advantage
- The field is rapidly evolving, offering exciting future possibilities
- Experiment, iterate, and push boundaries to achieve more with LLMs in Kaggle competitions
